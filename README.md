# Vite Vue Project Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions to set up and run both the backend (BE) and frontend (FE) of the project.

## Backend Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend server:

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The backend server will run on port 3000.

## Frontend Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend application:

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
